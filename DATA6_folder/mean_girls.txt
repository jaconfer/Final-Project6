FADE IN:
INT. CADY'S ROOM. EARLY MORNING.
There are boxes around the undecorated room. The clock says 6:29 am.
C.l\DY HERON, 15, lies in bed asleeo. She is naturally pretty. Her
long hair has never been dyed. Her eyebrows have never been nlucked. She has a fantastic tan. -
The clock hits 6:30 and the alarm goes off. Cady opens her eyes.
CADY
(groggy) Okay, I'm up.
Cady closes her eyes for what seems like a second. When she opens them again, the clock says 7:15.
Cady screams and jumps out of bed.
INT. HALLWAY.- A FEW MINUTES LATER.
Cady rushes out. Now she's wearing khaki pants, a faded izod, and a
khaki bucket.hat. Her nom rushes bv her.
BETSY
You're gonna be late. Come here.
I'll braid your hair.
INT. CADY'S KITCHEN. A FEW MINUTES LATER.
The kitchen is full of boxes. Cady (hair french-braided) pours. two
bowls of cat food. Two cats come running. They hiss at each other.
CADY
Cleo, be nice! Pamela! Stop it!
While the cats are fighting, a big droopy dog strolls in behind them.
CHIP (O.S.) Come out front, Cady. I wanna get a
photo.
Cady is still wrestling with the cats.
CADY
Stop fighting. There's enough for
~verybody. _
Cady puts the cats by their bowls, but the dog has· eaten all their fooa.
CADY
Why don't you fight with him?
The dog's slobbering face.

Cady's father CHIP, 43, a lanky professorial type, takes a picture of
Cady and her mother BETSY, 43. (Betsy is attractive but not concerned
with style. The kind of woman who would still wear a fanny pack.)
CHIP
That's good. Stay close.
Betsy bursts into tears.
BETSY
My baby's going to school.
Cady comforts her mother.
CADY (V.O.) I guess it's natural for parents to
cry on their kid's first day of
school. But this usually happens when
the kid is five.
Betsy has pulled Cady close and is hugging her.

CADY (V, O.) I'm 15, and until today, I was homeschooled. That means my mom was my only teacher and my Dad was the only sub. I know what you're thinking. Home-schooled kids are freaks.

Chip climbs down to give Betsy a hug and a kiss.

Cadv starts across the street. She is almost hit by a big yellow school bus. She jumps back as her mother yelps.

I'm okay. Sorry. I'll be careful.
Cady crosses the street. Hip hop blares from a car radio.
Cady passes the different groups outside the school. A group of black students sitting on the grass.

MR. DUVALL, the African American 10th grade dean enters. He looks
around for the homeroom teacher.
MR. DUVALL
Where's your teacher?
Their homeroom teacher, MS. SHARON NORBURY, enters. She is hip- looking, 32. Bright but maybe not the most organized teacher.
MRS • NORBURY
Okay , I'm late so I brought donuts.
